### What is our Mechanic
- Jetpack function to fly over pitfalls and navigate through our small obstacle course
- Speed up Charge pad we use this to fly to unattainable areas of large distances!!!
- Run button will help you get a bit of a boost when you start to fly anywhere in the level before going back to the normal travelling speed.
- There will be a limit on the jetpack for how much fuel will be used before you begin falling to your doom. Jetpack fuel will recharge after a certain amount of time.
### Objective Statement
- We want to see what kind of gameplay challenges can be built around using a jetpack as the primary mode of navigation.
- We want to know if jetpack gameplay is a fun way to navigate a game world.
