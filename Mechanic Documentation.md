# Rapid-Prototype-1-Tristan-Ryan-Devon-
## Design Rationale  
We want players to experience the joy of flying around with a jetpack while overcoming unique challenges. While jet packs have been used in games before, they usually take the form of a temporary power up. We want to test how a jetpack can be used as the primary form of navigation.  

### What is our Mechanic
- Jetpack function to fly over pitfalls and navigate through our small obstacle course
- Speed up Charge pad we use this to fly to unattainable areas of large distances!!!
- Run button will help you get a bit of a boost when you start to fly anywhere in the level before going back to the normal travelling speed.
- There will be a limit on the jetpack for how much fuel will be used before you begin falling to your doom. Jetpack fuel will recharge after a certain amount of time.
### Objective Statement
- We want to see what kind of gameplay challenges can be built around using a jetpack as the primary mode of navigation.
- We want to know if jetpack gameplay is a fun way to navigate a game world.

### Questions for our employer  
1. What do you expect for our individual process work? 
2. What level of quality do expect for this prototype? (Graphics, how many mechanics) 
3. Is it all right to have secondary mechanics to enhance our main mechanic/feature? 
4. How many bugs are we allowed to ship with? 
5. Are any bonus marks for additional features that help showcase our main mechanic? 
6. How do you make a separate document that will show up in proper markdown format?  
7. What is a GitHub release page?
